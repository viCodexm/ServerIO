# Server IO  
This repository contains my own solution to Track 7 Technical task for Huawei Future Star Internship program.  

## How it works
Server gets WRITE / READ requests in specified time (read from requests.txt)  
Server can handle N requests simultaneously  

Request structure and everything else read in *track7-task.pdf*  

I used AVL tree to handle memory occupancy by WRITE operations.  
Hope you like it.
